      <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>Hey there! Currently I'm a paramedic who has just started a web development bootcamp to add some new skills to the resume. 
          ultimately I'm looking to start a career in the tech industry and leave my EMS roots behind. 
        </p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
        <p>Southern CA </p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Learning!</strong> This world is far too diverse and amazing to never experience all it has to offer!</li>
          <li><strong>Video Games</strong> Yeah... I'm a nerd. From FPS to Racing to RPGs, there's always some game I'm obsessed with!</li>
          <li><strong>Backpacking/Hiking</strong>"In every walk with nature one receives far more than he seeks." -John Muir</li>
          <li><strong>Watching Sports!</strong> LA Rams, Anaheim Ducks, and the <u>Anaheim</u> Angels</li>
        </ul>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>I'm still looking for that...</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>Deep within my thoughts and imagination</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>To make dat mad Zuckerburg money!!! All jokes aside, I'm leaving EMS (Emergency Medical Services) to find a better paying job with better hours with
          and a better work/life balance. Web development seems like a career where that may be more feasable. Mix that with the idea of being able to excercise
          my own creativity through the creation of websites... I'm highly intrigued.
